#API Gateway JSON Trace Formatter

It's just a tool which format the transaction trace in JSON format to something readable.

It prints the circuit path, the different legs (headers and payload), and the trace of the transaction.

That's just an html file, so open it with your web browser, select the trace file and ... voila.

##Additional Notes

- Just tested with Firefox but it should work other browsers
- Most use case has been tested, but might be not all.
